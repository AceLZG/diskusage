## Features
- A primitive tool for getting folder(s) sizes
- Command line environment only
- Supports both folders and disks as arguments
- Recursive passes through subfolders
- Calculates size of each folder
- Analyzes on defined depth of subfolders
- Sets limit how much folders will be printed in a results
- Fast

## Main cons
- No any dummies protection (also pros)
- No any intelligents features (also pros)

## Releases
[Releases here](https://github.com/aleksaan/diskusage/releases)

Releases available as single executable files â€“ just [download latest release](https://github.com/aleksaan/diskusage/releases) for your platform, unpack and run.

## Start on Windows - simple usage

```cmd
diskusage.exe -path "c:/somedir"
```
if you want to get c:/somedir first level subfolders sizes

```cmd
diskusage.exe -path "c:/somedir" -depth 2
```
if you want to get c:/somedir first & second level subfolders/files sizes


## Start on Windows - advanced usage

```cmd
diskusage.exe -path "c:/somedir" -limit 20 -fixunit "Gb" -depth 3 -sort "size_desc"
```
if you want to get 20 biggest directories across c:/somedir with a three subfolder's levels depth. All results will be represented in Gb.


where:
```cmd
-path "c:/somedir"
``` 
is a folder name (required)
```cmd 
-limit 20
```
is how much biggest folders will be printed in the results (optional)
if you set -limit to 0 it means limitless (no one row be cuted from results). Be warned it might be a huge list of files!
```cmd 
-fixunit "Gb"
```
you can choose unit style to representing folder sizes. It can be fixed or dynamic-scaled.
You can use "fixunit" in case you want to compare sizes afterward (optional).
```cmd 
-depth 3
```
is depth of subfolders to analyze (optional)

```cmd 
-sort "size_desc"
```
sets sorting (order) of printed results (optional)
It should be also "name_asc" like windows explorer default sorting


## Save results to a file
For integration with a other systems I recommend create a batch file like this:
```cmd
diskusage.exe -path "c:/somedir" > results.txt
```
