## Releases

Releases available as single executable files â€“ just [download latest release](https://github.com/aleksaan/diskusage/releases) for your platform, unpack and run.

## Start on Windows

```cmd
diskusage.exe -path "C:/Temp; D:/" -limit 20 -fixunit "Gb"
```
where:
```cmd
-path "C:/Temp; D:/"
``` 
is set of disk(s) / folder(s) separated by semicolon (required)
```cmd 
-limit 20
```
is how much max-sized folders you want to see in the results (optional)
```cmd 
-fixunit "Gb"
```
is a fixed unit of dir-size for a results (optional). If this parameter doesn't set then you get dynamic-scaled results in a more comfort units for each folder. You can use "fixunit" in case you want to compare sizes afterward.

For integration with a other systems I recommend create a batch file like this or more complex if you want:
```cmd
del results.txt
diskusage.exe -path "C:/" -limit 20 >> results.txt
rem pause
rem see to results.txt
```
