## Features
- A primitive tool for getting folder(s) sizes
- Comfortable setup (yaml config)
- Supports both folders and disks as arguments
- Recursive passes through subfolders
- Calculates size of each folder
- Analyzes on defined depth of subfolders
- Sets limit how much folders will be printed in a results
- Fast
- Saves results to csv-file

## Main cons
- No any dummies protection (also pros)
- No any intelligents features (also pros)

## Releases

Releases available as single executable files â€“ just [download latest release](https://github.com/aleksaan/diskusage/releases) for your platform, unpack and run.

## Simple usage (Windows example)

Put ```diskusage.exe``` into analyzed directory, run it and get results in ```out.txt```

* config.yaml will be created with a default settings

## Advanced usage (Windows example)

(Optional) Download, create or save ```config.yaml``` near ```diskusage.exe```.

Open ```config.yaml``` in text editor to setup diskusage

You will see:
```yaml
# Analyzer options
analyzer: 
  path: 'D:\_docs'
  depth: 5
# Result's options
printer:
  limit: 20
  fixunit: Gb
  tofile: out.txt
  ```
where:
```yaml
   path: D:\_docs
``` 
is a folder or disk name (required)

```yaml
   depth: 5
```
is depth of subfolders to analyze (optional)

```yaml
   limit: 20
```
is how much biggest folders will be printed in the results (optional)
if you set -limit to 0 it means limitless (no one row be cuted from results). Be warned it might be a huge list of files!
```yaml
   fixunit: Gb
```
you can choose unit style to representing folder sizes. It can be fixed or dynamic-scaled.

If you omit 'fixunit' it means dynamic-scaled units style.

Fixed scale values: b, Kb, Mb, Gb, Tb, Pb.

You can use "fixunit" in case you want to compare sizes afterward (optional).

```yaml
   tofile: out.txt
```

File name to save results. If value is empty file will not be created and you will see results in console window with prompt to exit at the end.

Run ```diskusage.exe```
